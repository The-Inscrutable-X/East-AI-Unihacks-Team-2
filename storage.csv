"The titular character is a homeless man named Bill Dunn who is tricked by an evil scientist into consuming an experimental drug",
"The drug gives Dunn the powers of mind-reading, mind-control, and clairvoyance",

"They wanted to become syndicated newspaper strip authors, so they showed their ideas to various newspaper editors",
"However, the newspaper editors told them that their ideas weren't sensational enough",
"If they wanted to make a successful comic strip, it had to be something more sensational than anything else on the market",
"This prompted Siegel to revisit Superman as a comic strip character",
"Siegel modified Superman's powers to make him even more sensational: Like Bill Dunn, the second prototype of Superman is given powers against his will by an unscrupulous scientist, but instead of psychic abilities, he acquires",
"superhuman strength",
"bullet-proof skin",
"Additionally, this new Superman was a crime-fighting hero instead of a villain, because Siegel noted that comic strips with heroic protagonists tended to be more successful",
"In later years, Siegel once recalled that this Superman wore a "bat-like" cape in some panels, but typically he and Shuster agreed there was no costume yet, and there is none apparent in the surviving artwork",
"Siegel and Shuster showed this second concept of Superman to Consolidated Book Publishers, based in Chicago",
"In May 1933, Consolidated had published a proto-comic book titled",
"Detective Dan: Secret Operative 48",
"It contained all-original stories as opposed to reprints of newspaper strips, which was a novelty at the time",
"Siegel and Shuster put together a comic book in a similar format called",

"A delegation from Consolidated visited Cleveland that summer on a business trip and Siegel and Shuster took the opportunity to present their work in person",

"Siegel believed publishers kept rejecting them because he and Shuster were young and unknown, so he looked for an established artist to replace Shuster",
"When Siegel told Shuster what he was doing, Shuster reacted by burning their rejected Superman comic, sparing only the cover",
"They continued collaborating on other projects, but for the time being Shuster was through with Superman",
"Siegel wrote to numerous artists",
"The first response came in July 1933 from Leo O'Mealia, who drew the",
"Fu Manchu",
"strip for the",
"Bell Syndicate",
"In the script that Siegel sent O'Mealia, Superman's origin story changes: He is a "scientist-adventurer" from the far future when humanity has naturally evolved "superpowers"",
"Just before the Earth explodes, he escapes in a time-machine to the modern era, whereupon he immediately begins using his superpowers to fight crime",
"O'Mealia produced a few strips and showed them to his newspaper syndicate, but they were rejected",
"O'Mealia did not send to Siegel any copies of his strips, and they have been lost",
"In June 1934, Siegel found another partner: an artist in Chicago named Russell Keaton",
"Keaton drew the",
"Buck Rogers",
"comic strips",
"In the script that Siegel sent Keaton in June, Superman's origin story further evolved: In the distant future, when Earth is on the verge of exploding due to "giant cataclysms", the last surviving man sends his three-year-old son back in time to the year 1935",
"The time-machine appears on a road where it is discovered by motorists Sam and Molly Kent",
"They leave the boy in an orphanage, but the staff struggle to control him because he has superhuman strength and impenetrable skin",
"The Kents adopt the boy and name him Clark, and teach him that he must use his fantastic natural gifts for the benefit of humanity",
"In November, Siegel sent Keaton an extension of his script: an adventure where Superman foils a conspiracy to kidnap a star",
"The extended script mentions that Clark puts on a special "uniform" when assuming the identity of Superman, but it is not described",
"Keaton produced two weeks' worth of strips based on Siegel's script",
"In November, Keaton showed his strips to a newspaper syndicate, but they too were rejected, and he abandoned the project",
"Siegel and Shuster reconciled and resumed developing Superman together",
"The character became an alien from the planet Krypton",
"Shuster designed the now-familiar costume: tights with an "S" on the chest, over-shorts, and a cape",

"Siegel and Shuster also showed him Superman and asked him to market Superman to the newspapers on their behalf",
"In October, Wheeler-Nicholson offered to publish Superman in one of his own magazines",

"He had been slow to respond to their letters and hadn't paid them for their work in",
"New Fun Comics",
"They chose to keep marketing Superman to newspaper syndicates themselves",
"Despite the erratic pay, Siegel and Shuster kept working for Wheeler-Nicholson because he was the only publisher who was buying their work, and over the years they produced other adventure strips for his magazines",

"Another inspiration was slapstick comedian",

"Whereas comic books in the 1950s were read by children, since the 1990s the average reader has been an adult",
