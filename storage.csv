"Lightning is a giant spark of electricity in the atmosphere between clouds, the air, or the ground.",
"In the early stages of development, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud and between the cloud and the ground.",
"When the opposite charges build up enough, this insulating capacity of the air breaks down and there is a rapid discharge of electricity that we know as lightning.",
"The flash of lightning temporarily equalizes the charged regions in the atmosphere until the opposite charges build up again.",
"Lightning can occur between opposite charges within the thunderstorm cloud (intra-cloud lightning) or between opposite charges in the cloud and on the ground (cloud-to-ground lightning).",
"Lightning is one of the oldest observed natural phenomena on earth.",
"It can be seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, in large hurricanes, and obviously, thunderstorms.",
"Read more about NSSL's lightning research .",
"Lightning causes thunder! Energy from a lightning channel heats the air briefly to around 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit, much hotter than the surface of the sun.",
"This causes the air to explode outward.",
"The huge pressure in the initial outward shock wave decreases rapidly with increasing distance and within ten yards or so has become small enough to be perceived as the sound we call thunder.",
"Thunder can be heard up to 25 miles away from the lightning discharge, but the frequency of the sound changes with distance from the lightning channels that produce it, because higher frequencies are more quickly absorbed by the air.",
"Very close to lightning, the first thunder you hear is from the closest channels,which produce a tearing sound, because that thunder contains high frequencies.",
"A few seconds later, you hear a sharp click or loud crack from lightning channels a little farther away, and several tens of seconds later the thunder from the most distant part of a flash has quieted to low frequency rumbling.",
"Because light travels through the air roughly a million times faster than sound does, you can use thunder to estimate the distance to lightning.",
"Just count the number of seconds from the time you see a flash until you hear thunder.",
"Sound travels approximately one fifth of a mile per second or one third of a kilometer per second, so dividing the number of seconds by 5 gives the number of miles to the flash and dividing by 3 gives the number of kilometers.",
"Where does lightning strike?.",
"Most, if not all, lightning flashes produced by storms start inside the cloud.",
"If a lightning flash is going to strike ground, a channel develops downward toward the surface.",
"When it gets less than roughly a hundred yards of the ground, objects like trees and bushes and buildings start sending up sparks to meet it.",
"When one of the sparks connects the downward developing channel, a huge electric current surges rapidly down the channel to the object that produced the spark.",
"Tall objects such as trees and skyscrapers are more likely than the surrounding ground to produce one of the connecting sparks and so are more likely to be struck by lightning.",
"Mountains also make good targets.",
"However, this does not always mean tall objects will be struck.",
"Lightning can strike the ground in an open field even if the tree line is close by.",
"What causes lightning?.",
"The creation of lightning is a complicated process.",
"We generally know what conditions are needed to produce lightning, but there is still debate about exactly how a cloud builds up electrical charges, and how lightning forms.",
"Scientists think that the initial process for creating charge regions in thunderstorms involves small hail particles called graupel that are roughly one quarter millimeter to a few millimeters in diameter and are growing by collecting even smaller supercooled liquid droplets.",
"When these graupel particles collide and bounce off of smaller ice particles, the graupel gains one sign of charge and the smaller ice particle gains the other sign of charge.",
"Because the smaller ice particles rise faster in updrafts than the graupel particles, the charge on ice particles separates from the charge on graupel particles, and the charge on ice particles collects above the charge on graupel.",
"Laboratory studies suggest that graupel gains positive charge at temperatures a little colder than 32 degrees Fahrenheit, but gains negative charge at colder temperatures a little higher in the storm.",
"Scientists think the two largest charge regions in most storms are caused mainly by graupel carrying negative charge in the middle of the storm and ice particles carrying gained positive charge in the upper part of the storm.",
"However, a small positive charge region often is below the main negative charge region from graupel gaining positive charge at lower, warmer altitudes.",
"Small ice particles that have collided with negative graupel in the lower region can contribute positive charge to the middle of the storm.",
"A conceptual model shows the electrical charge distribution inside deep convection (thunderstorms), developed by NSSL and university scientists.",
"In the main updraft (in and above the red arrow), there are four main charge regions.",
"In the convective region but outside the outdraft (in and above the blue arrow), there are more than four charge regions.",

"NSSL team launches an instrumented weather balloon to study lightning in northern Florida.",
"NSSL researchers were pioneers in the science of launching instrumented weather balloons into thunderstorms.",
"This capability allowed NSSL to collect weather data in the vicinity of tornadoes and drylines, and all the way up through a thunderstorm, gathering critically needed observations in the near-storm environment of thunderstorms.",
"In addition, these mobile labs and ballooning systems provided the first vertical profiles of electric fields inside a thunderstorm leading to a new conceptual model of electrical structures within convective storms.",

"In addition to electrical wiring damage, the other types of possible damage to consider include structural, fire, and property damage.",
"Prevention and mitigations.",
"The field of lightning-protection systems is an enormous industry worldwide due to the impacts lightning can have on the constructs and activities of humankind.",
"Lightning, as varied in properties measured across .",
"as it is, can cause direct effects or have secondary impacts; lead to the complete destruction of a facility or process or simply cause the failure of a remote electronic sensor; it can result in outdoor activities being halted for safety concerns to employees as a thunderstorm nears an area and until it has sufficiently passed; it can ignite volatile commodities stored in large quantities or interfere with the normal operation of a piece of equipment at critical periods of time.",
"Most lightning-protection devices and systems protect physical structures on the earth, aircraft in flight being the notable exception.",
"While some attention has been paid to attempting to control lightning in the atmosphere, all attempts proved extremely limited in success.",
"Chaff and silver iodide crystal concepts were devised to deal directly with the cloud cells, and were dispensed directly into the clouds from an overflying aircraft.",
"The chaff was devised to deal with the electrical manifestations of the storm from within, while the silver iodide salting technique was devised to deal with the mechanical forces of the storm.",
"Lightning protection systems.",
"An example of a standard, pointed-tip, air terminal.",
"Hundreds of devices, including .",
"and charge transfer systems, are used to mitigate lightning damage and influence the path of a lightning flash.",
"A lightning rod (or lightning protector) is a metal strip or rod connected to earth through .",
"and a grounding system, used to provide a preferred pathway to ground if lightning terminates on a structure.",
"The class of these products is often called a "finial" or "air terminal".",
"A lightning rod or "Franklin rod" in honor of its famous inventor, .",
", is simply a metal rod, and without being connected to the lightning protection system, as was sometimes the case in the past, will provide no added protection to a structure.",
"Other names include "lightning conductor", "arrester", and "discharger"; however, over the years these names have been incorporated into other products or industries with a stake in lightning protection.",
"Lightning arrester, for example, often refers to fused links that explode when a strike occurs to a high-voltage overhead power line to protect the more expensive transformers down the line by opening the circuit.",

"To do so, one should tune a standard AM .",
"receiver to a frequency with no transmitting stations, and listen for crackles among the .",
"Stronger or nearby lightning strikes will also cause cracking if the receiver is tuned to a station.",
"As lower frequencies propagate further along the ground than higher ones, the lower medium wave (MW) band frequencies (in the 500–600 kHz range) can detect lightning strikes at longer distances; if the longwave band (153–279 kHz) is available, using it can increase this range even further.",
"Lightning-detection systems.",
"have been developed and may be deployed in locations where lightning strikes present special risks, such as public parks.",
"Such systems are designed to detect the conditions which are believed to favor lightning strikes and provide a warning to those in the vicinity to allow them to take appropriate cover.",
"National Lightning Safety Institute.",
"advises American citizens to have a plan for their safety when a thunderstorm occurs and to commence it as soon as the first lightning is seen or thunder heard.",
"This is important, as lightning can strike without rain actually falling.",
"If thunder can be heard at all, then a risk of lightning exists.",
"The safest place is inside a building or a vehicle.",
"If inside, avoid electrical equipment and plumbing, including taking a shower.",
"Risk remains for up to 30 minutes after the last observed lightning or thunder.",
"The National Lightning Safety Institute recommends using the F-B (flash to boom) method to gauge distance to a lightning strike.",

"But light travels 300,000 km/sec, almost a million times the speed of sound.",
"Sound travels at the .",
"of about 340 m/sec (depending on the temperature), so the flash of lightning is seen before thunder is heard.",
"A method to determine the distance between lightning strike and viewer involves counting the seconds between the lightning flash and thunder.",
"Then, dividing by three to determine the distance in kilometers, or by five for miles.",
"Immediate precautions against lightning should be taken if the F-B time is 25 seconds or less, that is, if the lightning is closer than 8 km or 5 miles.",
"A report suggested that whether a person was standing up, .",
", or lying down when outside during a thunderstorm does not matter, because lightning can travel along the ground; this report suggested  being inside a solid structure or vehicle was safest.",

"All events associated or suspected of causing damage are called "lightning incidents" due to four important factors.",
"Forensic evidence of a lightning termination, in the best investigated examples, are minuscule (a pit in metal smaller than a pen point) or inconclusive (dark coloration).",
"The object struck may explode or subsequent fires destroy all of the little evidence that may have been available immediately after the strike itself.",
"The flash channel and discharge itself are not the only causes of injury, ignition, or damages, i.",
", ground currents or explosions of flammables.",
"Human sensory acuity is not as fine as that of the milliseconds in duration of a lightning flash, and people's ability to observe this event is subject to the brain's inability to comprehend it.",
"Lightning-detection systems are coming online, both satellite and land-based, but their accuracy is still measured in the hundreds to thousands of feet, rarely allowing them to pinpoint the exact location of the termination.",
"As such it is often inconclusive, albeit highly probably a lightning flash was involved, hence categorizing it as a "lightning incident" covers all bases.",
