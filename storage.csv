"i like how the drum mag is also compatable with my tornado strike gun as well i like how there is no pumping involved this gun is a good gun if your on the run cause  you can run and pull the trigger at the same time to slow your enemy down i originally got this gun for my sis because its too hard for her to pump and she loves it my sis is 8 years old and its hard for her to carry the gun with the huge clip so  got some of the regular sized clips and now she loves it even more the only draw back to this gun is that if your enemy gets a hold of this gun then your screwed!!!",
